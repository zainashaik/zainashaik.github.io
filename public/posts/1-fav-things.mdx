- photographing pretty things and pretty people (which is everyone btw)
- collecting tidbits of the world to add to my scrap-binder (I think it's more flexible than a scrapbook)
- turning ramblings into writings
- putting on henna at 2 am for cultural South Asian events
- traveling with my friends and family
- over-accessorizing my outfits with butterflies
